commands

docker version - make sure client and engine are ok
docker info - most config values of engine
docker - avaiable commands

CLI STRUCTURE

- old (still works): docler <command> (options)

- new docker <command> <sub-command> (options) # use this


docker management command AND subcommand
docker container run

#1 image vs. container
#2 run/stop/remove containers
#3 check container logs and processes

#1 
image is the applocation we want to run
container is a instance of that image running as a process

you can have many containers running off the same image

get images from "registry's" the oficial is dockerhub.


>> docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx 

- what it does?
1. Download image 'nginx' from docker hub
2. start a nw container from that image
3. Opened port 80 on the host IP
4. Routes that traffic to the container IP, port 80


>> docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx 

--detach (option): runs container in the background.


>> docker container ls (new way)
>> docker ps           (old way)

list all running containers

-a (option) show all

for each run command, one docker is created.

if you wanto to give a name and not a generic docker name:

>> docker container run --publish 8000:80 --detach --name webhost nginx

get logs:
supose a container with name: webhost

>> docker container logs webhost (new)
>> docker logs 			 (old)

list running processes in specific container
>> docker container top webhost

you can't remove a running container

to rm a container that is running, you can stop running containers
or use option -f to force.

>> docker container rm -f <container-id>

>> docker container stop


#4 What happens in 'docker container run' ?

1. looks for that image locally in image cache, if dosent find ->2
2. Looks in remote image repository (default to docker hub)
3. Downloads the latest version (if default)
4. creates new container based on that image and prepares to start
5. gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
6. opens up port 80 on host and forwards to port 80 in container (if default)
7. starts container by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile

ex:

docker container run --publish 8000:80 --name webhost -d nginx:1.1 nginx -T

#5 Containers vs VM

containers:

-They are just processes
-limited to what resources they can acess
-Exit when process stops

ex

docker run --name mongo -d mongo

docker top mongo

* in this example, only one process running

ps aux <linux command, shows all processes running>

doc.docker.com and --help

assignment

run all of them:

- run all of them: nginx, mysql and httpd server with --detach and --name;
	- nginx should liste on 80:80;
	- httpd on 8080:80;
	- mysql on 3006:3306;
- when running  mysql, use the --env option (or -e) to pass in
MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes ; 
- use docker containers logs on mysql to find the random
password it created on startup;
- clean it all up with docker container stop and docker
container rm (both can accept multiple names or ID's);
- use docker containers ls to ensure enverything is correct
before and after cleanup;

>> docker container run --publish 8000:80 --detach --name webhost nginx

tip:
Would the following two commands create a port conflict 
error with each other?

docker container run -p 80:80 -d nginx
docker container run -p 8080:80 -d nginx

Incorrect, remember the docker port publishing format of 
<public port>:<container port>. 
Port conflict errors occur when multiple services are running 
on the same published port on the same host, not in multiple 
containers. Each container gets its own internal IP behind NAT, 
so the ports won't conflict across two container network interfaces.

- What is going on in containers?

docker container top - process list in one container
docker container inspect - details of one container config
docker container stats - performance stats for all containers

getting a shell inside containers: No need for ssh


Getting a shell inside containers

docker container run -it  -start new container interactively
docker container exec -it -run additional command in existing

diffs linux distros in containers

-t : pseudo-tty

simulates a real terminal, like what SSH does

-i : interactive

Keep session open to receive terminal input

docker container rin [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARGS...]

so, inside docker you can use for example

docker container run -it --name webhost nginx bash

containers only run as long as the command that it
ran on startup runs.

since we changed it to bash, simply exiting bash quit it.

lets test in ubun

docker container run -it --name img-ubuntu ubuntu

inside ubuntu we can run:

apt-get update
apt-get install curl , for example

but, when you exit the container, wyith you try
to run a ubuntu img again with 'docker container run'
you gonna create a new container.

to use this container with curl you should use

docker container start -ai

-a : attach 
-i : interative

with docker container start --help

we have that:

docker container start [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]

you can use forexample:

docker container start -ai <IMG NAME>
docker container start -ai <CONTAINER ID>


what if I want to actually see the shell inside
a running container that's already running something like mysql

docker container exec 

Run additional process in running container

doc:

docker container exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]

lets test in a contaniner running a mysql


first lets create the mysql container:
option 1: docker container run --detach --name database --env MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWOED=yes mysql

option 2: docker container run --publish 3006:3306 --detach --name database --env MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql

if op2:

docker container exec -it database bash


of toppic
apt-get update && apt-get install -y procps

docker pull alpine

docker container run -it alpine sh
app manager in alpine is:
apk, you can install bash if you need it

review:

docker container run -it - start new container interactively
docker container exec -it -run a additional command in existing container

for local dev/testong, networks usually 'just work'

quick port check with docker container port
learn concepts of docker networking
understando how network packets move around docker


look at 
remember:
-p : publish
and is always in the format: HOST:CONTAINER

docker container run -p 80:80 --name webhost -d nginx

docker container port webhost

kill all containers 
docker container rm -fv $(docker ps -aq)

docker container inspect --format


docker container run -d -n database -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql

get container IP
docker container inspect --fromat '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress  }}' webhost

dddd

obs: docker container run <stuff> nginx

use: docker container run <stuff> nginx:alpine


docker network ls

docker network inspect

docker network create --driver
docker network connect
docker network disconnect


spwawns a new virtual network for you to
attach containers to


docker Networks: DNS

- understand how DNS is the key to easy inter-container comms
- see how it works by default with custom networks
- learn how to use --link to enable DNS on default bridge network

talk with other

static IP's and using IP's fot talking to containers
is an anti-pattern. Do your best to avoid it.

container migh go away/ migth fail

docker daemon has a built-in DNS server
that cotaniers use by default

create a new network
docker network create my_app_net

docker container run -d --name webhost1 --network my_app_net nginx:alpine

(you can see: docker network inspect <container id>)
if there is a running container, you can connect it to your app net with:
docker network connect 

DNS connection
docker container exec -it webhost1 ping webhost2


the bridge network (default) doeent permit that.
you have to use --link


so is a good pratice to using custom networks.

containers shouldn't rely on IP's for inter-comm

DNS for friendly names is builçt-in if you use cuustom nets
this get way easier with docker compose in future section;


recap:

docker container top -  top is used for looking at running processes *inside* a container.
docker container stats - used to show performance statistics of all containers.
docker container inspect - show the output of the processes happening live in a container.
docker container logs - shows you the container configuration. It can also be modified to only return a specific piece of data using the —format flag.

By using the 'docker exec -it <container> sh' (or bash) command on a container, we can connect to a shell from inside it.

multiple containers to be able to communicate with each other on the same docker host you should use
the default bridge network driver allow containers to communicate with each other when running on the same docker host.

The --rm causes Docker to automatically remove the container when it exits.
