commands

docker version - make sure client and engine are ok
docker info - most config values of engine
docker - avaiable commands

CLI STRUCTURE

- old (still works): docler <command> (options)

- new docker <command> <sub-command> (options) # use this


docker management command AND subcommand
docker container run

#1 image vs. container
#2 run/stop/remove containers
#3 check container logs and processes

#1 
image is the applocation we want to run
container is a instance of that image running as a process

you can have many containers running off the same image

get images from "registry's" the oficial is dockerhub.


>> docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx 

- what it does?
1. Download image 'nginx' from docker hub
2. start a nw container from that image
3. Opened port 80 on the host IP
4. Routes that traffic to the container IP, port 80


>> docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx 

--detach (option): runs container in the background.


>> docker container ls (new way)
>> docker ps           (old way)

list all running containers

-a (option) show all

for each run command, one docker is created.

if you wanto to give a name and not a generic docker name:

>> docker container run --publish 8000:80 --detach --name webhost nginx

get logs:
supose a container with name: webhost

>> docker container logs webhost (new)
>> docker logs 			 (old)

list running processes in specific container
>> docker container top webhost

you can't remove a running container

to rm a container that is running, you can stop running containers
or use option -f to force.

>> docker container rm -f <container-id>

>> docker container stop


#4 What happens in 'docker container run' ?

1. looks for that image locally in image cache, if dosent find ->2
2. Looks in remote image repository (default to docker hub)
3. Downloads the latest version (if default)
4. creates new container based on that image and prepares to start
5. gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
6. opens up port 80 on host and forwards to port 80 in container (if default)
7. starts container by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile

ex:

docker container run --publish 8000:80 --name webhost -d nginx:1.1 nginx -T

#5 Containers vs VM

containers:

-They are just processes
-limited to what resources they can acess
-Exit when process stops

ex

docker run --name mongo -d mongo

docker top mongo

* in this example, only one process running

ps aux <linux command, shows all processes running>

doc.docker.com and --help

assignment

run all of them:

- run all of them: nginx, mysql and httpd server with --detach and --name;
	- nginx should liste on 80:80;
	- httpd on 8080:80;
	- mysql on 3006:3306;
- when running  mysql, use the --env option (or -e) to pass in
MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes ; 
- use docker containers logs on mysql to find the random
password it created on startup;
- clean it all up with docker container stop and docker
container rm (both can accept multiple names or ID's);
- use docker containers ls to ensure enverything is correct
before and after cleanup;

>> docker container run --publish 8000:80 --detach --name webhost nginx

tip:
Would the following two commands create a port conflict 
error with each other?

docker container run -p 80:80 -d nginx
docker container run -p 8080:80 -d nginx

Incorrect, remember the docker port publishing format of 
<public port>:<container port>. 
Port conflict errors occur when multiple services are running 
on the same published port on the same host, not in multiple 
containers. Each container gets its own internal IP behind NAT, 
so the ports won't conflict across two container network interfaces.
